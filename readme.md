# Polarbear

This is polarbear. It's a project I'm working on.

The goals right now are to make a simple but usable language. I plan to have a [structural type system](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system), that is fully type-inferred.

The plan is to compile to C. I want to start with a very simple language with no type system, then add type inference and type checking.
