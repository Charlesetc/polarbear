[ ] Convert to a partially typed tree.
[ ] Type infer the rest of the types of the tree.
[ ] Translate the type-inferred tree to an expanded view without generics.
[ ] Translate this static tree to c.
[ ] End-to-end tests.
[ ] Write a usable garbage collector in c.
[ ] Write a basic standard library in c.
